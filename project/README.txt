OVERVIEW
Project:          WPI - Assistments
PI:               Neil Heffernan
Curriculum:       
Dates:            Sep 7, 2005 - Aug 30, 2006
Domain/LearnLab:  Math/Other
Tutor:            
Description:      
Has Study Data:   Not Specified
Status:           complete
School(s):        
Additional Notes: 2010-01-19: Reloaded. (Alida) Due to the fact that students saw different
                  tutorings for the same problems, different steps can be prefixed with the
                  same step number (See problem 10018 as an example). The bigger problem is
                  when the same scaffolds are prefixed with different step numbers and
                  datashop treats them as different steps. (Hui)
